TODO:  
- Add baseline examples with both linear and non-linear simulations.
- Convert ALL globals to new strucutured global array
- Do work on code structure to allow for new integration methods, multi-rate possibiliites, and variable time stepping algorithms.
- Add checks for 'old' to new system creation/initialization due to new global variable scheme.
- Eensure timing capabilities for speed up comparisons.  
- Add AGC model and area definitions to buses.
- Investigate line current monitoring.
