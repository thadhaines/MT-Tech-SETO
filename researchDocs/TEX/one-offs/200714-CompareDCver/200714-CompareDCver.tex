\paragraph{Summary}
\begin{itemize}
\item A HVDC case has been created and tested as working in all versions of PST. 
\item Using the structured global approach increases speed by over 2 times.
\item Minor differences exist between version 2.3 and 3.1 in non-linear simulation output.
\item All linear results match between versions, but do not match non-linear output \\(possibly due to improper data handling - no prior examples were found).
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Scenario Description} \ 
A 16 bus system with one HVDC link and four machines equipped with st3 exciters, pss, and governors was perturbed by a 0.1 PU active load pulse from $t=1$ to $t=2$

\paragraph{Non-Linear Results} \ 
The new pstSETO version was based on version 3.1 so it makes sense that there are no differences in machine speed or bus voltage and angle.
Total non-linear simulation time in 3.1 was 18.876 seconds, while pstSETO was 8.853 seconds (reduced from 12.619 seconds pre-DC-global adaptation into structure).\\

The differences between version 3.1 and 2.3 range from  $10^{-11}$ to $10^{-9}$.
There must have been changes to the way DC lines were initialized between versions. 
Value changes pre-event are mysterious.\\

\paragraph{Linear Results} \ 
All versions provide the same output, however it does not match non-linear data.
This is very possibly due to improper data handling as there was no example on using linear simulation for systems involving DC lines.
