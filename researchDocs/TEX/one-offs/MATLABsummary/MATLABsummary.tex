Work in progress notes of interest from \emph{MATLAB programming with Applications for Engineers} by Stephen J. Chapman 2013.

\paragraph{Chapter 6 \& 7} \ \\
MATLAB passes by value, i.e. copies are made of input arguments to functions. 
Apparently, there is some mechanism in place that detects if an input variable is changed; and if not, then pass by reference is used.
The exact operation this process was not exactly explained in detail and feels pretty sketchy to rely on an automatic process that may largely affect a programs operation.

\subparagraph{Function Notes}
Functions have specific commands that may be useful:
\begin{itemize}
\item nargin
\item nargout
\item inputname
\item nargchk
\end{itemize}

MATLAB allows for \verb|persistent| variables to be declared in a function.
These variables are not cleared at the completion of a funciton and instead remain in the the functions local workspace.

\subparagraph{Function Functions} \ \\
MATLABs `function functions' are functions that accept other functions as input.
Some useful function functions are:
\begin{itemize}
\item eval('some string') : evaluates input string as if it were typed into the command window.
\item feval('someFunc', vals) : evaluates given named function with input values.
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{Function Search Order}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sub functions (functions defined inside a named function)
\item Private functions (functions defined inside a folder named \verb|private| in the current directory)
\item Current directory functions (functions defined in current folder)
\item MATLAB path
\end{enumerate}

\subparagraph{Function Handles} \ \\
Function handles can be used to `rename' a function.

\begin{verbatim}
fHandle = @funcName; % creates handle fHandle that would act the same as funcName
fHandle = str2func('funcName'); % same operation as above.
\end{verbatim}

\subparagraph{Anonymous Functions} \ \\
One line functions without a name. 
Returns a function handle that accepts defined input arguments.
\begin{verbatim}
>> aFunc = @(x) x^2;
>> aFunc(4)
ans =
    16
\end{verbatim}
