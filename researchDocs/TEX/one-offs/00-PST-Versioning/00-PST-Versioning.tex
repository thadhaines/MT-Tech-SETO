\item 3.0 - From Joe Chow's website. 
Includes fixes and alterations. Notibably multiple DC lines and PSS modifications.
\item 3.1 - Based on 3.0, includes Dan Trudnowski's pwrmod and ivmmod models in non-linear simulation. 
pwrmod included linear simulation and various model patches. 
Generator tripping is included, but untested.
\item 3.1.1 - Based on 3.1. Ryan Elliott's version with energy storage and updated linear simulation along with various other fixes and code cleanup alterations. 
Not to be included in GitHub repository.
\item SETO - Based on 3.1. New global structure. 
Includes automatic generation (AGC) models and variable time step (VTS) options.
