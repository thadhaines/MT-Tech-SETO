			%\item Be aware of multi rate methods % mostly TAMU/Power world
		%	\item Decide on PST base version (3.1$\longrightarrow$SETO$\longrightarrow$4.0)
			\item Run long term simulation to show benefits of VTS.
		%	\item Allow them to duplicate work.

		%\item Started work on batch unit testing

\paragraph{Current Tasks:}
\begin{enumerate}
	\itemsep 0em 
		
	\item Work on un-trip functionality:

	\item Create extended term event:
		\begin{itemize}
			\footnotesize
			\itemsep0em
			\item Use miniWECC and pwrmod
			\item Issue: rolling blackouts in CA
			\item High PV penetration
			\item Drought has led to lower hydro output
			\item Initial low N$\longrightarrow$S flows
			\item Solar generation declines as load increases %every evening
			\item Inadequate CA dispatchable generation %in CA to replace PV
			\item Leads to large N$\longrightarrow$S flows
			\item EIA data from 8/14/20 18:00? % 12% reservese, blackouts followed 30 minutes later
		\end{itemize}
	\item Work towards PST 4.0.0:
		\begin{itemize}
			\footnotesize
			\itemsep0em
			\item Optimize Y-matrix reduction when tripping generators
			\item Verify and Validate operation of AGC, PWRMOD, IVMMOD, and VTS.
			\item Refine documentation	
			\item Clean up examples
			\item Clean up code/comments
			\item Clean up readme files
		\end{itemize}
	\item \href{https://github.com/thadhaines/MT-Tech-SETO/blob/master/researchDocs/TEX/one-offs/200720-PSTandAGC/200720-PSTandAGC.pdf}{Rework AGC doc to better explain model/example?}

\paragraph{Current Questions:}
	\begin{enumerate}
	\itemsep0em 
	
	\item Only 1 pwrmod \textbf{model} allowed per case?
	\item Real data for case?
%	\item Induction machines have no speed?\\ only angle?
%	\item PST modeling of transformers?
%	\item Play in data for variable solar irradiance? (Slow Sine with step events for clouds.)
%	\item PSS design doesn't seem to be used in normal simulation?
%	\item Deadlines of any sort?
	
	\end{enumerate}	

\paragraph{Loose ends:} % Random stuff that will be left undone...
	\begin{enumerate}
	\itemsep 0 em
	\item As infinite buses don't seem to be used in dynamic simulation, they were not converted to use the golbal g.
		\item \verb|tgh| model not converted for use with global g. (no examples of tgh gov)
		\item In original (and current) \verb|s_simu|, the global \verb|tap| value associated with HVDC is over-written with  a value used to compute line current multiple times. \\It probably shouldn't be.
		\item Constant Power or Current loads seem to require a portion of constant Impedance.
		\item PSS design functionality not explored
		\item No examples of of delta P omega filter or user defined damping controls for SVC and TCSC models
		\item Differences in \verb|mac_ind| between pst 2 and 3 seem backward compatible - untested.
		\item DC is not implemented in VTS - Just combine into main routine? Seems counter intuitive to do multi-rate variable time step integration.
		\item AGC capacity should consider defined machine limits instead of assuming 1 PU max.
		\item AGC should allow for a `center of inertia' frequency option instead of the weighted average frequency.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	
	\paragraph{Coding Thoughts:} 
		\begin{enumerate}
	
			\itemsep 0em 
		%	\item Condense $\approx$340 globals into 1 structured array with $\approx$18 fields based on category.
		%	\item Create new \verb|s_simu_Batch| style script that functionalizes the newtork and dynamic calculations so that standard MATLAB ODE solvers may be used.
			%\item Enable `objects' (structure of arrays), but include functions to interact with condensed globals so vectorized operations are still possible.\\
		%	This requires more conceptual modeling to understand what needs to be passed/references/changed for each `object'.
		%	Would enable addition of area definitions to models.
		%	\item Separate total system calculation of derivatives into scripts/functions to allow for easier changing of integration method.
		%	Possibly employ \verb|feval| for a more dynamic calculation routine.
			\item Rework how switching \& perturbance events are handled into a more flexible and general format. (flags? objects?)
	%		\item Generate something similar to unit test cases to verify code changes don't break everything during refactor.
			\item Generate comparison scripts to verify simulated results match  between code revisions and modifications.
