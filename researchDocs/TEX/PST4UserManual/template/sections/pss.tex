\section{Power System Stabilizer Model}  
There was a modification to the washout time constant in the power system stabilizer (PSS) model between PST version 2 and 3 that affects the output of the model in a fairly drastic way.
To accommodate for this, PST 4 has two PSS files named \verb|pss2| and \verb|pss3| which mimic the computation of each PST version PSS model respectively.
This enables the user to specify which PSS model should be used by copying the numbered PSS files over the non-numbered PSS file.
\begin{minted}{MATLAB}
copyfile([PSTpath 'pss2.m'],[PSTpath 'pss.m']); % use version 2 model of PSS
copyfile([PSTpath 'pss3.m'],[PSTpath 'pss.m']); % use version 3 model of PSS
\end{minted}
The default PSS model used in PST 4 is \verb|pss2|.

%Alternatively, a \verb|pssGainFix| variable may be set to 1, or true, which will adjust the version 2 data from a \verb|d_| file to work the same way with the version 3 model.
%This is accomplished by executing: \verb|pss_con(:,3) = pss_con(:,3)./pss_con(:,4);|
%While this works, it's kind of confusing and may be removed.
