\section{Octave Compatibility}
To more fully support free and open-source software, PST 4 has been developed to be compatible with Octave.
It should be noted that more experimental features, like VTS, hasn't been tested fully in Octave.
It is known that not all ODE options that exist in MATLAB are included in Octave.
Current Octave compatible solution methods are:
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep 0 em
\singlespacing
\item huens
\item ode23
\item ode15s
\end{itemize}
Additionally, MATLAB simulations run are generally faster than Octave.
It should be noted that when using Octave, calls to save and load data must include explicit file endings (i.e. \verb|save someData.mat|).
