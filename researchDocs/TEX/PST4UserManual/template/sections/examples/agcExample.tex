\section{Automatic Generation Control} 
A variety of examples were created for AGC testing.
While some may use VTS, this section covers information only related to AGC.
The VTS example section contains VTS specific information.

The \verb|0-examples/AGC| folder contains all system and modulation files associated with the AGC examples.
The \verb|run***| files are designed to run PST in using the batch mode.
