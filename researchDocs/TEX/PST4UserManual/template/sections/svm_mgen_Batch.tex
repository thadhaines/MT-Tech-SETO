\section{svm\_mgen\_Batch}

Linear analysis was performed by \verb|svm_mgen| in previous versions of PST.
While the \verb|svm_mgen| script still exists in PST 4, it is not updated to use the structured global \verb|g|.
Instead, the \verb|svm_mgen_Batch| script is used to run linear analysis using a batch style process.
The operations performed by the two scripts are similar, though \verb|svm_mgen_Batch| does not prompt the user for any input and \textbf{is} modified to use the structured global g.
Example cases that use \verb|svm_mgen_Batch| are listed in Section \ref{sec: modExamples}.
