\section{Reset Original Files Function (resetORIG)} 
As the operation of PST involves replacing system models and modulation files, the need to restore all original files can be very useful.
Especially if unexpected behavior is observed in simulation output.
The \verb|resetORIG| script replaces all possible model and modulation files with the default versions.
As of this writing, the correct operation of this script is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Navigate to root PST 4 directory in MATLAB
\item Execute \verb|resetORIG|
\end{enumerate}
A text message should be displayed stating the restoration process has completed.

If other models are preferred for default use, the restoration process can be modified.
Simply change the \verb|**_ORIG| file name to the file that should be copied instead.
