This is the voltage behind an impedance model Dan created.
It's meant to model a `grid forming' converter where voltage and angle are manipulatable.
While there are questions about the reality of such operations, the model exists and appears to work in the non-linear simulation  of PST 4.
There is documentation that should probably be moved into this document.
