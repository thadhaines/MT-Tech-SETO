\section{Internal Voltage Model (ivmmod) - WIP}  
This is the ideal voltage behind an impedance model Dan created.
It's meant to model a `grid forming' inverter where voltage and angle can be set.
While there are questions about the reality of such operations and how PST simulates them, the model exists and appears to `work' in the non-linear simulation  of PST 4.
There is pre-existing documentation and an example that should be condensed into this document.
