\section{Internal Voltage Model (IVMMOD)}  
This is the voltage behind an impedance model Dan created.
It's meant to model a `grid forming' converter where voltage and angle can be set to mimic a `grid-forming' inverter.
While there are questions about the reality of such operations, the model exists and appears to work in the non-linear simulation  of PST 4.
There is pre-existing documentation and an example that should be condensed into this document.
