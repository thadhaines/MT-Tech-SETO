\section{Automatic Generation Control}  \label{sec: AGC def}
Automatic generation control (AGC) is an extended-term model that acts to restore system frequency and area interchange values to set values over the course of minutes.
This restoration is accomplished by calculating an area control error (ACE) that is distributed to controlled generation sources to correct any deviation from reference values.

%model calculates an area control error (ACE) and distributes it to defined controlled generators according to participation factor.
%The ACE signal is passed through a PI filter before being distributed to each generator through a unique low pass filter that adds the negative of the value to the governor \verb|tg_sig| value.
%( NOTE: the \verb|tg_sig| value is equivalent to an addition to the governors $P_{ref}$ value)
%The \verb|agc_indx| function creates the required data structures and indices.

\subsection{AGC Definition Example}
The following AGC settings are not realistic, but useful in demonstrating the required user definitions and functionality of the AGC model.
Settings from one AGC model can be easily copied to another using \verb|agc(2) = agc(1)| and then changing the area number and \verb|ctrlGen_con| array as desired.

%{  AGC definition
Each agc(x) has following fields:
    area        - Area Number 
    startTime   - Time of first AGC signal to send
    actionTime  - Interval of time between all following AGC signals
    gain        - Gain of output AGC signal
    Btype       - Fixed frequency bias type
        0 - absolute - Input B value is set as Frequency bias (positive MW/0.1Hz)
        1 - percent of max area capacity
    B           - Fixed frequency bias value
    Kbv         - Varaible frequency bias gain used to gain B as B(1+kBv*abs(delta_w))
    condAce     - Conditional ACE flag
        0 - Conditional ACE not considered
        1 - ace2dist updated only if sign matches delta_w (i.e. in area event)
    Kp          - Proportional gain
    a           - ratio between integral and proportional gain (placement of zero)
    ctrlGen_con - Controlled generator information
        column 1 - Generator External Bus Number
        column 2 - Participation Factor
        column 3 - Low pass filter time constant [seconds]

\subsection{Weighted Average Frequency (calcAveF)} 
An inertia weighted average frequency is used as the `actual' frequency $\omega$ in ACE calculations.
The \verb|calcAveF| function calculates an average weighted frequency for the total system and for each area (if areas are defined).
System values are stored in \verb|g.sys.aveF| and area values are stored in \verb|g.area.area(x).aveF| where \verb|x| is the area number.
The calculation involves a sum of system inertias that changes with generator trips.


\vspace{1em}
In a system with $N$ generators, $M$ areas, and $N_M$ generators in area $M$, the \verb|calcAveF| function performs the following calculations for each area $M$:

\begin{equation}{\label{eq: areaH} }
H_{tot_M} = \sum_{i}^{N_M} MVA_{base_i}H_i
\end{equation}\eqcaption{Area Inertia Calculation} 
\vspace{-1em}
\begin{equation}{\label{eq: areaF} }
F_{ave_M} = \left( \sum_{i}^{N_M}Mach_{speed_i}MVA_{base_i}H_i \right) \dfrac{1}{H_{tot_M}}
\end{equation}\eqcaption{Area Average System Frequency Calculation}
\vspace{0.5 em}

\noindent System total values are calculated as:

\begin{equation}{\label{eq: systemH} }
H_{tot} = \sum_{i}^{M} H_{tot_M}
\end{equation}\eqcaption{System Inertia Calculation} 
\vspace{-1em}
\begin{equation}{\label{eq: systemF} }
F_{ave} = \left( \sum_{i}^{M} F_{ave_M} \right) \dfrac{1}{M}
\end{equation}\eqcaption{System Average System Frequency Calculation}
\vspace{0.5 em}

\noindent If $M==0$ (areas are not defined), \verb|calcAveF| performs:

\begin{equation}{\label{eq: systemH2} }
H_{tot} = \sum_{i}^{N} MVA_{base_i}H_i 
\end{equation}\eqcaption{Area-less System Inertia Calculation} 
\vspace{-1em}
\begin{equation}{\label{eq: systemF2} }
F_{ave} = \left( \sum_{i}^{N}Mach_{speed_i}MVA_{base_i}H_i \right) \dfrac{1}{H_{tot}}
\end{equation}\eqcaption{Area-less System Average System Frequency Calculation}\vspace{0.5 em}

\subsection{Other Area Calculations (calcAreaVals)}  
The \verb|calcAreaVals| function calculates real and reative power generated by all area machines and actual area interchange every time step.
It should be noted that power injected via loads, pwrmod, or ivmmod are not included in the \verb|g.area.area(n).totGen(k)| value.
An area's actual interchange is calculated using the \verb|line_pq2| function to collect area to area line power flows.
