\section{Power Injection Model (PWRMOD)}  
This is the power or current injection model Dan created for version 2.3.
It's meant to model the `grid-following' type of converters.
It is included in both the non-linear and linear simulation modes of PST 4.
There is pre-existing documentation and examples that should be condensed into this document.
