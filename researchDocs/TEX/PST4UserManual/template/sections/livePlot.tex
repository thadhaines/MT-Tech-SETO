\section{livePlot Function}  
Function that creates plot during non-linear simulation.
While this operation existed in previous versions of pst, it is now functionalized to allow users to more easily define what is displayed (if anything) during simulations.
The \verb|livePlot| function is designed to be overwritten in a similar fashion as pss or machine models previously described.
