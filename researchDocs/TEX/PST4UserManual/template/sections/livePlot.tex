\section{livePlot Function} 
Default action of PST 3 was to plot the bus voltage magnitude at the faulted bus.
However, it may be useful to plot other values or turn off the plotting during a simulation.
The live plotting is now functionalized to allow users to more easily define what is displayed (if anything) during simulations.
The \verb|livePlot| function is designed to be overwritten in a similar fashion as PSS or machine models previously described.

There are currently XXX live plot functions:

\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|liveplot_ORIG| - original faulted bus voltage plot.
\item \verb|liveplot_1| - faulted bus voltage and system machine speeds plus any lmod signals
\item \verb|liveplot_2| - AGC signals
\end{itemize}

It should be noted that the live plotting can cause extremely slow simulations and occasional crashes.
