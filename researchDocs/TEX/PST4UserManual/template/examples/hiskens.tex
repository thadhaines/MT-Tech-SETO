\section{Standard Faulting (hiskens)}
Standard PST simulations involve some kind of fault defined in the \verb|sw_con| array.
This example (located in the \verb|hiskens| folder) is included to showcase some simple differences between PST versions using a standard test case.
System data for this example comes from a report by Ian Hiskens \cite{hiskens2013} which summarized a study of an IEEE 10 generator, 39 bus system.
Ryan Elliott at Sandia National Labs recreated the system in a PST format and provided the data file for this project.
A one-line diagram of the system is shown in Figure \ref{fig: hiskens oneline}.

The simulated event was a 0.1 second three-phase fault with no loss of line between bus 2 and 3.
The \verb|run_datane_hiskens.m| file can be used to run the simulation.
Figure \ref{fig: hiskens results} shows the resulting fault bus voltage magnitude and system generator speeds.

All PST versions (when using the same models) provide the same results, but there are differences in simulation speed and data output.
Table \ref{tab: hiskens} shows that the PST 4 simulation was roughly twice as fast as PST version 2 or 3, saved less data, and left fewer variables in the MATLAB workspace post simulation.
These improvements are likely due to the restructuring of global variables and code to remove any `all zero` data from being saved.\\
