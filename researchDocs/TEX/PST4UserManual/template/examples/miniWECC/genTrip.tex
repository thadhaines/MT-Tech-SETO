\subsection{miniWECC-genTrip - WIP} \label{ex: mw gentrips}
Example shows multiple generator trips in one simulation and the use of the miniWECC system in all versions.
Main differences between 3.1 and 4 is overall simulation speed (PST 4 is $\approx$2x faster), the zeroing of tripped machine derivative, and system inertia calculations.\\

PST 3 does not zero derivatives of tripped machine speeds.
As a result, tripped machine speeds increase greatly despite not having any effect on the rest of the connected system.

PST 4 zeros derivatives of tripped machine speeds so that the machine will stay at whatever speed it was tripped at.
This zeroing of derivatives is helpful when using VTS as time step size is determined by all derivatives in a system.

PST 4 calculates system total inertia and accounts for tripped generators.
