%A brief explanation of the user manual purpose and major content would make sense.
The purpose of this user manual is to document work done on PST 3 to form PST 4. 
It is meant only to augment the previous user manuals and other available documentation about \mbox{PST} \cite{chow1992, PST2LFTut, PST3manual, chow2015}.
%
Major code changes presented include 
how global variables are handled
and the
functionalization of the non-linear simulation routine.

\vspace{1em}
Descriptions of new models created for
inverter based resources
%power (or current) injection, 
%a voltage source behind a reactance,
and
automatic generation control
are also presented.
Additionally, work to add functionality to PST such as
variable time step integration routines,
generator tripping, % mention un-tripping
and
code compatibility with Octave
is documented.



\vspace{1em}
To demonstrate and debug new and old PST capabilities, an example library has been created and brief explanations of select examples is be included in this document.
Unfortunately, due to time constraints, details may be rather lacking.
however,  the code examples have been checked for functionality and should work as designed.

%and intentions may only matter so much.
