This section should contain props to ol' Graham Rogers and Joe Chow for making this software.
It could also provide a bit of history about how PST has developed into its current form.

After all that, a brief explanation of the user manual purpose and content would make sense.
Maybe highlight/foreshadow major changes and additions that are explained in more detail later.

Possibly mention the funding that made this work possible.
