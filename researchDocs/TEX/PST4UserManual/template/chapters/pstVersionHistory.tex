\item 1.0 - Original PST circa 1991.
\item 2.0 - Updated PST circa 1999.
\item 2.1 - Dr. Dan Trudnowski added power and current injection via the pwrmod model circa 2015.
\item 2.2 - Dr. Dan Trudnowski added arbitrary generator tripping functionality circa 2019.
\item 2.3 - Dr. Dan Trudnowski added a voltage behind a reactance model as ivmmod circa 2019.
\item 3.0 - Updated PST obtained from Joe Chow's website circa 2020. 
Includes fixes, alterations, and MIT license.
Addition of multiple DC lines and PSS modifications.
\item 3.1 - Based on 3.0, incorporates Dr. Trudnowski's pwrmod and ivmmod models in non-linear simulation, machine tripping functionality, and various model patches.
pwrmod included in linear simulation as well. 
\item 3.1.1 - Based on 3.1. Version by Ryan Elliott at Sandia National Labs with energy storage and updated linear simulation along with various other fixes and code cleanup alterations. 
\item 3.1.2 - Based on 3.1.1. Work in progress version by Ryan Elliott to clean up global variables.
\item SETO - Based on 3.1. Experimental version by Thad Haines using a new global structure, automatic generation control, and variable time step (VTS) integration. 
%\item 4.0.0-aX - Alpha version of PST 4 based on SETO version. 
%Includes a refined VTS routine, confirmed multi-generator tripping, and improved AGC action/modulation.

%Examples in repository will be re-worked/updated and cleaned to use this version, 
%documentation of changes will be updated, 
%and PST code will be cleaned up where possible.
%May go into beta, which may then go into the `release candidate' phase, but may also just turn into 4.0.0.
%\end{itemize}

%\section*{Possible Future Versions}
%\begin{itemize}
\itemsep 0 em
\item 4.0.0 - Released circa October 2020. Based on SETO version. 
Includes a refined VTS routine, confirmed multi-generator tripping, improved AGC action and modulation, code cleanup, example library, and documentation.
Represents the end result of four months of work by Thad Haines.
%\item 4.1.0 - Based on 4.0.x - planned to incorporate energy storage models for non-linear simulation and possibly the updated linear simulation based on 3.1.1. Examples of \verb|ess| model use required.
