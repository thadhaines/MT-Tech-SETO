\chapter{Code Fixes}
The purpose of this section is to record fixes to PST code from version 3 to version 4.

%=============================
\section{exc\_dc12}  
In 2015 there were `errors' corrected in the saturation block that create differences between version 2 and 3 of this model.
Effects are noticeable, but a solution hasn't been investigated yet.

%=============================
\section{exc\_st3}  
Corrected theta index to \verb|n_bus| from \verb|n| per Ryan Elliott.
Corrected simple \verb|*| to \verb|.*| int the \verb|if ~isempty(nst3_sub)| section.

%=============================
\section{lmod}  
Fixed state limiting.
 While if over-limit, the derivative was set to zero, the state was not set to the maximum/minimum value correctly.
 
%=============================
\section{mac\_tra}  
Commented out code that prevented the setting equal of the transient reactances.

%=============================
\section{rlmod}  
Fixed state limiting.
 While if over-limit, the derivative was set to zero, the state was not set to the maximum/minimum value correctly.
