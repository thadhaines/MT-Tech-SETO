\chapter{General Model or Bug Fixes}

This content will likely be separated into the changes/additions section as not all following sections are specific to code fixes but also additions/changes.
%content copied from PSTsetoVersionChanges on 09/03/20 -thad 

The purpose of this section is to record changes of note made to PST over the course of the SETO work that may be worth not forgetting about.
It should be noted that PST SETO is based on PST version 3 and not \textbf{all} changes are recorded here.


%===========================================================================================================
\section{exc\_dc12}  
In 2015 there were `errors' corrected in the saturation block that create differences between version 2 and 3 of this model.
Effects are noticeable, but a solution hasn't been investigated yet.

%===========================================================================================================
\section{exc\_st3}  
Corrected theta index to \verb|n_bus| from \verb|n| per Ryan Elliott.
Corrected simple \verb|*| to \verb|.*| int the \verb|if ~isempty(nst3_sub)| section.

%===========================================================================================================
\section{mac\_tra}  
Commented out code that prevented the setting equal of the transient reactances.

%===========================================================================================================
\section{lmod and rlmod}  
Fixed state limiting.
 While if over-limit, the derivative was set to zero, the state was not set to the maximum/minimum value correctly.
