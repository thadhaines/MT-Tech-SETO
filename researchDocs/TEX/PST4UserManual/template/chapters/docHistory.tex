\chapter{Document History}
It'd make sense if this turned into a table...

\begin{itemize}
\item 09/02/20 - 0.0.0-a.1 - document creation...
\item 09/03/20 - 0.0.0-a.2 - Population with sections and some previously generated content, addition of glossary
\item 09/07/20 - 0.0.0-a.3 - Added and alphabetized more sections, collected raw material from research documents
\item 09/08/20 - 0.0.0-a.4 - Figure and equation formatting in AGC, more logical sectioning, minor editing
\end{itemize}
