\chapter{Examples Explained - WIP}
Examples are located in the \verb|0-examples| folder and are designed to be run in batch mode.
This means that each example copies any required system, model, or modulation file to the main PST directory before running.
Typically, each example folder contains a \verb|.m| file that starts with \verb|run| that can be used to run the example.
As example cases are located on a github repository, relative file paths are used so that examples can be run without much difficulty from various different machines.
While most examples can be run in multiple versions of PST, some functionality can only be found in specific versions.

\noindent The general structure of created examples tend to reflect the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\itemsep 0em
\item Clear all variables, close all figures, and clear the command window
\item Define which version of PST to use
\item Create a relative path to the root directory of chosen PST version
\item Copy any system, model, or modulation file to the PST root directory
\item Run \verb|s_simu|
\item Save output data
\item Restore any model, or modulation file to original state
\item Create data plots
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item Experimental VTS
\item AGC
\item AGC interchange modulation
\item Extended term with VTS
\item MiniWECC via Dan
\item Experimental Un-tripping
\item Modulation via \verb|_mod| files
\item Linear simulation where applicable...
\item Combine examples? 
\end{itemize}

Variables to note in associated examples (where \verb|x| is the internal model number):
\begin{itemize}
\item exciter $V_{ref} = $ \verb|g.exc.exc_pot(x,3)|
\item governor $P_{ref} = $ \verb|g.tg.tg_pot(x,5)|
\item governor $\omega_{ref} = $ \verb|g.tg.tg_con(x,3)|
\end{itemize}
