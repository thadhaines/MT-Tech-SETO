# Modified Thesis-Template for User Manual

A LaTeX template that makes a document with the following sections:
* Cover Page
* Abstract
* Dedication Page
* Acknowledgments
* Table of Contents
* List of Tables
* List of Figures
* List of Equations
* Glossary of Terms (very basic)
* Body content chapters
* Bibliography
* Appendices

The current content in the .tex files serves as a minor tutorial/reference on how to use the template. Further LaTeX information is widely available on the internet. A nice intro to LaTeX can be found [here][1]. The authoritative user's guide and reference manual is available for purchase [here][2].

NOTE: This template is designed to be built with LuaLaTeX and use biber as a bibliography backend.
