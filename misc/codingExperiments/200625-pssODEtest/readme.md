The purpose of pssODEtest is:
1. See if a MATLAB ODE solver can interface with the PST models
2. If so, compare PSS models from v2.3, 3.1, and a MATLAB representation.
This test has been temporarily abondoned as of 06/29/20.  

The purpose of pssODEtest2 is:
1.  Use a statespace system in ODE45
2.  Explore options of ODE45
3.  Compare output from a fixed step lsim to the variable step ode45
This test was completed and results recorded ini pssODEtest2.m
